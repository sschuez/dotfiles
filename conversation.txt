> I'm currently reviewing my terminal setup. So far i've used oh my zsh, as you can see in my zshrc. However, I'm open to exploring different alternatives. In particular, I find the setup of omarchy's bash intriguing checkout 
  ../other-resouces/omarchy/default/bash and tell me the pros and cons of this setup vs my currnet setup.

⏺ I'll help you compare your current oh-my-zsh setup with the omarchy bash configuration. Let me first examine your current zshrc and then look at the omarchy bash setup.

⏺ Read(.zshrc)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Read(other-resouces/omarchy/default/bash)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Let me check your directory structure and find your zshrc file:

⏺ List(~/code/dotfiles)
  ⎿  Listed 133 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ List(other-resouces)
  ⎿  Listed 2 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me check for the other-resouces directory (note it might be spelled differently):

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/other*")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

⏺ Read(zshrc)
  ⎿  Read 122 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me look for the omarchy directory with different spellings:

⏺ Bash(find /Users/stephenschuz/code/dotfiles -type d -name "*omarchy*" -o -name "*bash*" 2>/dev/null | head -10)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me check if there might be a typo in "other-resouces" (should be "other-resources"):

⏺ Bash(find /Users/stephenschuz/code -type d -name "*other*" -o -name "*resource*" -o -name "*omarchy*" 2>/dev/null | head -10)
  ⎿  /Users/stephenschuz/code/projects/archive/mortgageWebscraper/existing_solution/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/docker/models/resource.py

⏺ It seems the omarchy bash setup directory you mentioned doesn't exist in your dotfiles. However, I can analyze your current zsh setup and provide insights. Let me also check your custom theme:

⏺ Read(themes/common.zsh-theme)
  ⎿  Read 88 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Since the omarchy bash setup directory you mentioned doesn't exist in your current dotfiles, I can provide a general comparison based on your current oh-my-zsh setup. However, if you have the omarchy bash configuration elsewhere or can provide
  the correct path, I'd be happy to do a specific comparison.

  Your Current Oh-My-Zsh Setup (Pros & Cons)

  Pros:
  - Rich plugin ecosystem: Using zplug with quality plugins (autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, git tools)
  - Smart navigation: zoxide + autojump for enhanced directory navigation
  - Development-friendly: Integrated nvm, pyenv, rbenv for multiple language environments
  - Clean custom theme: Minimal but informative prompt with git status
  - Good history management: Shared history with deduplication
  - Tmux integration: Auto-updates window names based on directory

  Cons:
  - Startup performance: Multiple plugins and tools can slow shell initialization
  - Memory overhead: zsh + oh-my-zsh + plugins use more resources than minimal bash
  - Complexity: Many moving parts (zplug, oh-my-zsh, multiple env managers)
  - Dependency-heavy: Relies on external tools (homebrew, zplug, etc.)

  General Bash Alternative Benefits

  Without seeing the specific omarchy setup, typical bash advantages include:
  - Speed: Faster startup and execution
  - Simplicity: Fewer dependencies and moving parts
  - Portability: Available everywhere, minimal configuration needed
  - Resource efficiency: Lower memory usage

  Would you like to provide the correct path to the omarchy bash configuration, or would you prefer recommendations for a minimal bash setup that could match your current functionality?

> No it's not in the current directory, that's why I gave you ../.. it under ~/code/other-resources/ etc. Please check that out again.

⏺ You're right! Let me check the correct path with the proper spelling:

⏺ List(~/code/other-resources)
  ⎿  Listed 670 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now let me examine the omarchy bash setup:

⏺ Read(~/code/other-resources/omarchy/default/bash/rc)
  ⎿  Read 8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(~/code/other-resources/omarchy/default/bash/aliases)

  ⎿  Read 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(~/code/other-resources/omarchy/default/bash/functions)
  ⎿  Read 53 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me check the other bash files:

⏺ Read(~/code/other-resources/omarchy/default/bash/inputrc)
  ⎿  Read 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Comparison: Your Oh-My-Zsh Setup vs Omarchy Bash Setup

  Omarchy Bash Setup - Pros:

  Minimalism & Performance:
  - Ultra-fast startup: No plugin loading overhead, minimal initialization
  - Low memory footprint: Pure bash with only essential tools
  - Clean architecture: Modular structure (separate files for aliases, functions, envs, etc.)
  - No dependencies: Doesn't rely on external plugin managers or frameworks

  Smart Tooling:
  - Modern tools integration: Uses mise (instead of multiple *env managers), zoxide, fzf, eza
  - Excellent readline config: Advanced tab completion and history search
  - Practical utilities: Includes useful functions for video transcoding, disk formatting, compression

  Simplicity:
  - Minimal prompt: Just a simple caret (PS1=$'\uf0a9 ') with path in terminal title
  - Clean aliases: Well-thought-out shortcuts without bloat
  - Direct approach: No theme switching, just focused on functionality

  Omarchy Bash Setup - Cons:

  Limited Features:
  - No git integration: No git status in prompt or advanced git aliases
  - Basic prompt: Missing branch info, status indicators, colors
  - No syntax highlighting: No real-time command validation
  - No autosuggestions: No command completion based on history
  - Less ecosystem: Fewer community plugins and themes available

  Your Current Zsh Setup - Pros:

  Rich Features:
  - Git integration: Git status in prompt, extensive git tooling
  - Smart suggestions: zsh-autosuggestions with syntax highlighting
  - Advanced navigation: zoxide + autojump redundancy
  - Multi-language support: nvm, pyenv, rbenv all configured
  - Tmux integration: Auto-window naming
  - Theme flexibility: Easy theme switching system

  Your Current Zsh Setup - Cons:

  Complexity & Performance:
  - Slower startup: Plugin loading, oh-my-zsh initialization overhead
  - Higher memory usage: Multiple tools and plugins running
  - Dependency heavy: Relies on homebrew, zplug, oh-my-zsh ecosystem
  - Potential conflicts: Multiple similar tools (zoxide + autojump)

  Recommendation:

  The choice depends on your priorities:

  Choose Omarchy Bash if you want:
  - Maximum speed and minimal resource usage
  - Simple, distraction-free workflow
  - Modern CLI tools without bloat
  - To learn bash scripting better

  Stick with your current Zsh if you want:
  - Rich git integration and visual feedback
  - Extensive plugin ecosystem
  - Multiple language development workflows
  - Advanced terminal features and theming

  Hybrid approach: You could adopt some omarchy concepts in zsh:
  - Use mise instead of separate *env managers
  - Simplify your prompt
  - Replace some oh-my-zsh plugins with native alternatives
  - Use their excellent inputrc concepts in zsh

  Would you like me to show you how to implement any specific omarchy features in your current setup?

> Ok, i'd like to switch to the omarchy approach. Skip the stuff that doesn't make sense for a mac (not sure about the format drive or iso2sd e.g.). Other than that, let's try this approach for my terminal, because I do think I have a lot of 
  bloat. Keep the existing stuff for backup.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants to switch to the omarchy bash approach, which makes sense as it's much leaner. I need to:

  1. Create a backup of their current zsh setup
  2. Create a new bash configuration based on the omarchy setup
  3. Skip the Linux-specific stuff like format-drive and iso2sd functions
  4. Adapt the setup for macOS where needed
  5. Keep the essential functionality they have in their current setup

  Let me plan this with TodoWrite first since this is a multi-step task.

⏺ I'll help you switch to the omarchy bash approach while keeping your current setup as backup. This is a great choice for reducing bloat and improving performance.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Create backup of current zsh configuration          
     ☐ Create new bash directory structure based on omarchy

  🚀 To Switch to Bash

  1. Test it first (optional):
  bash --rcfile ~/code/dotfiles/bashrc
  2. Make it your default shell:
  chsh -s /bin/bash
  3. Link the bashrc:
  ln -sf ~/code/dotfiles/bashrc ~/.bashrc
  4. Restart your terminal or run:
  exec bash --login

  📦 Recommended Tools (for full experience)

  # Core tools for the best experience
  brew install eza zoxide fzf bat mise

  # Optional: Replace your version managers with mise
  mise install node@latest python@latest ruby@latest

  🔄 To Rollback (if needed)

  If you want to go back to zsh:
  chsh -s /bin/zsh
  rm ~/.bashrc  # Remove the symlink

  The new setup is much faster, cleaner, and follows the omarchy philosophy while keeping your essential development tools integrated.
